## Dataset
The dataset used for analysis and prediction is stored in the ./datasets/ directory. The original dataset is divided into separate files for each gas type, containing data points for concentration levels, timestamps, and environmental conditions. Additionally, a modified dataset is provided, combining the data for all gases into a single file for comparative analysis.
## Problem Statement
Existing LPG systems suffer from limitations in real-time monitoring, inadequate detection of gas leaks, pressure fluctuations, and inefficient response, mechanisms, posing significant safety risks. These safety concerns include the potential for fire, explosion, and health hazards due to gas leaks and improper handling of LPG. There is a pressing need for a comprehensive solution to enhance safety, improve monitoring capabilities, and mitigate the risks associated with LPG usage. 
## Solution 
Key features of the smart LPG system:
Real-time monitoring of gas levels, pressure, and
temperature.
Automatic detection of gas leaks and prompt alerts.
Integration with IoT technology for remote monitoring and
control.
Data analytics for predictive maintenance and optimization.
Benefits: enhanced safety, reduced risks of accidents, improved
efficiency, and cost savings.

## Conclusion

This gas leak detector system contains two features, this includes the SMS Gateway Module. Moreover, his gas leak detector system contains two features, this includes the SMS Gateway feature for only sending warning information regarding the gas leak to the user and the Alarm for the warning alert. There are some improvements which can be applied for future work, such as regarding the SMS Gateway, it needs to be enhanced with feature such as notifying the user whenever the remaining credit balance is insufficient. Another thing which can be enhanced is regarding the sensor, the sensors in this module do not include somewhat notification for notifying the user whenever the sensor not working properly or not connected to the microcontroller in some cases, therefore, it is recommended to add this kind of features in the future work for better refinement.
